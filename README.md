                        Pokedex Android App
                    
This repository contains the project for an Android App implementing a Pokedex. 
The app has the following features:

* Fetches Pokemon data from PokeApi using the pokekotlin wrapper.
* Saves and keeps Pokemon information offline, avoiding the need
  to refetch the same Pokemon data every time the application starts.
* Implements pull-to-refresh to update the API call.
* Displays for each Pokemon: ID, sprites, name, and types.
* Clicking on a card shows all the Pokemon's moves.
* Clicking on the default sprites shows the shiny version.
